# Netflix - IMDB Ratings
A Tampermonkey script to show IMDB ratings on Netflix. 

It adds IMDB ratings to the title overlay, title cards. Take a look to the attached screenshot. 

## Installation 
1) Install [tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net) extension
2) Install [script](https://github.com/methral/netflix-imdb/raw/master/netflix-imdb.user.js)

You should also check MetaStazz's skip intro script..

## Limitation
Currently the script only uses the title name to get the imdb rating, so in case of multiple imdb matches, it may link to the wrong title.
